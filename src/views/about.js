                        <p className='gutter'>I'm a product designer with a passion for environmental
                            sustainability and positive social change. I currently work at Boeing,
                            where I have the unique opportunity to impact the daily lives of its employees
                            by improving upon enterprise software and manufacturing processes.
                        </p>
                        <p className='gutter'>What I love most about being a designer is the chance to
                            practice empathy and creativity on a daily basis. I find it extremely 
                            rewarding to create designs that are not only useful to others, but also 
                            delightful to interact with. While I am an introvert at heart, I value
                            collaboration with others and see differences in perspectives as opporunities
                            for us to grow as individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p className='gutter'>In my free time I enjoy immersing myself in works of fiction,
                            whether it be movies, shows, or games. I am also learning to be a better cook
                            by expanding my repertoire of vegetarian recipes.
